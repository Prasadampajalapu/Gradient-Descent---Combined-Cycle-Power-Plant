    "3. Submit a csv file with only predictions for X test data. File should not have any headers and should only have one column i.e. predictions. Also predictions shouldn't be in exponential form.\n",
    "4. Your score is based on coefficient of determination. So it can be possible that nobody gets full score."

In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is colected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance.\n",
